  The Quasar Layout Drawer (also known as a Sidebar) is the element on the left
  side or right side of your screen, usually used for Navigation, which gets
  hidden on smaller screens (and can be activated by swiping them into view
  from the edge of the screen or by clicking/tapping on menu buttons) and is
  shown alongside the Page content on wide enough screens.
