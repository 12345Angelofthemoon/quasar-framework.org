Quasar Apps are made of high-level building blocks called components. Components allow you to quickly construct an interface for your App. Quasar comes with a number of components, including modals, action sheets, collapsibles, cards, dialogs, FAB, lists and many more.

Quasar Components are written as Web Components, so they embed HTML, CSS and Javascript code that you can use by just including an HTML tag in your Page and Layout templates.

Check out the examples (text and live demos for each platform) to see what each component looks like and to learn how to use each one.
