Scroll to see demos if on desktop.

## Images
<input type="hidden" data-demo="images">

Image gets resized to fit the container with `responsive` class.

``` html
<img class="responsive" src="...">
```

You also have `background-cover` CSS helper class which is good for DOM elements with an image set as background.

## Videos
<input type="hidden" data-demo="videos">

Embedding a video like Youtube is easy. It also resises to fit the container by default.
``` html
<div class="video">
  <iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3_tw44QsZQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```
