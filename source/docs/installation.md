title: Installation
---

First, install  Quasar CLI:
``` bash
$ npm install -g quasar-cli
```

Make sure you are running NodeJS >= 4.1.1.

Now install some global dependencies.
``` bash
$ npm install -g gulp mocha testem
```

Then create a project folder (in this case is called *q-project* but you can name it whatever you want).
``` bash
$ quasar create q-project
$ cd q-project
```

Finally install local project dependencies:
``` bash
$ npm install
```

You're all set now. You can start developing your application.
