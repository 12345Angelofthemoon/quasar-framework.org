title: What is Quasar?
---
Quasar is a modern HTML5 SPA (Single Page Application) front-end framework on steroids.
Some of its features:

### Responsive Website & Mobile App
<input type="hidden" class="demo-point" data-page="parallax">

![Build on one. Use it on all.](/images/responsive-banner.png "Build on one. Use it on all.")

Write code once and then deploy as a responsive website or as a native phone/tablet app. No need to waste time on HOW your content is displayed.. just focus on what your content is.


### CSS Framework
<input type="hidden" class="demo-point" data-page="buttons">

Quasar uses its own full-featured CSS Framework. You can tweak it and build your own theme to make your App's design distinctive.

### Focus on Content
<input type="hidden" class="demo-point" data-page="fab">

Quasar is a time-saver from many perspectives. You don't have to worry about a lot of things, including how your content is being displayed to best leverages the screen real-estate. The built-in components are responsive by default.

### Built for Speed
<input type="hidden" class="demo-point" data-page="list">

Quasar Framework has a lot of optimizations behind the scenes to make your App run really fast (and consume the lowest possible battery power) by using the integrated Build system described below.

### Build System
Build system out of the box to help you in managing an App folder, precompiling code, bundling it together, preparing it for deployment, running tests, live previewing of your code in browser(s). No need to write even a single line of code for this.

Trivial tasks like optimizing image files (and much more) are taken care of by default. Just issue Quasar CLI commands.

### Javascript in CommonJS Format
As well as ensuring your code is encapsulated and modular, CommonJS modules give you dependency management, scope isolation, and namespacing. They should be used in any JavaScript application that spans more than a few files. This is why every Quasar App Javascript file must adhere to. Don't worry about how code is compiled and bundled together because Quasar takes care of it.

### Two-Way Data Binding
Develop reactive UI with two-way data binding. No need to directly touch the DOM.

### Focus on Reusable Code
Focus on writing reusable web components as (reactive) HTML tags.

### Web Components
**There is a rich ecosystem of reactive HTML tags ready to be used provided by default.** Head on to the API to get to know them and use them to write as few lines of code as possible and yet enrich your App with beautifully crafted functionality.

You want a swipe-responsive sidebar or a menu with tabs, or a card? Use an HTML tag provided by Quasar Framework.

### CLI (Command Line Interface)
CLI available to help you in creating an App folder, building, testing, live previewing and ultimately managing App source code files.

### Enforced Code Quality
Code quality is enforced by the built-in code linters and by test system available out of the box.

### Live Preview
Live Preview as you write your code. Open multiple browsers and get them synchronized for click/scroll/form input events. More than that, whenever you change your code, the browsers automatically get refreshed. So forget the F5 button.

Even more, you have a "Responsive View" too which helps you to quickly switch between different screen sizes in your browser window.

### Semantic API
The API syntax is intuitive as if you talk to someone and tell it what you want. Example:
``` js
var cookies = quasar.get.all.cookies();
```
