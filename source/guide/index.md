title: What is Quasar?
---
Quasar is a SPA front-end framework on steroids. Some of its features:

### Desktop & Mobile App
Write code once and then deploy as a responsive website or as a phone/tablet app. No need to waste time on HOW your content is displayed.. just focus on what your content is.

### Focus on Content
Quasar is a time-saver from many perspectives. You don't have to worry about a lot of things, including how your content is being displayed to best leverages the screen real-estate. The built-in components are responsive by default.

### Build System
Build system out of the box to help you in managing an App folder, precompiling code, bundling it together, preparing it for deployment, running tests, live previewing of your code in browser(s). No need to write even a single line of code for this.

### Javascript in CommonJS Format
As well as ensuring your code is encapsulated and modular, CommonJS modules give you dependency management, scope isolation, and namespacing. They should be used in any JavaScript application that spans more than a few files. This is why every Quasar App Javascript file must adhere to. Don't worry about how code is compiled and bundled together because Quasar takes care of it.

### Two-Way Data Binding
Develop reactive UI with two-way data binding. No need to directly touch the DOM.

### Focus on Reusable Code
Focus on writing reusable web components as (reactive) HTML tags.

### Plugins
Easy plugin system to enhance Quasar's abilities. Write your own, share them on Github.

### CLI
CLI available to help you in creating an App folder, building, testing, live previewing and ultimately managing App source code files.

### Enforced Code Quality
Code quality is enforced by the built-in code linters and by test system available out of the box.

### Live Preview
Live Preview as you write your code. Open multiple browsers and get them synchronized for click/scroll/form input events. More than that, whenever you change your code, the browsers automatically get refreshed. So forget the F5 button.

Even more, you have a "Responsive View" too which helps you to quickly switch between different screen sizes in your browser window.

### Semantic API
The API syntax is intuitive as if you talk to someone and tell it what you want. Example:
``` js
var cookies = quasar.get.all.cookies();
```
