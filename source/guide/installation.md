title: Installation
---
Use the `Quasar CLI` to generate or manage a Quasar App.

Make sure you have at least NodeJS 4.2.0 (latest always recommended) and latest NPM.
``` bash
$ npm install -g quasar-cli
```

Now you can create your first App. Let's initialize a folder (for this example: *qApp*, but you can name it whatever you want) with all the boilerplating necessary:
``` bash
$ quasar new qApp
$ cd qApp
```

You're all set now. Read about the Quasar CLI [here](/guide/cli-commands.html). Get to know how powerful it is so you can leverage it.
