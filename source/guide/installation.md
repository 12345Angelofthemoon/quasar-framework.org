title: Installation
---
Use the `Quasar CLI` to generate or manage a Quasar App.

Make sure you have latest NodeJS (>= 4.2.0) and NPM.
``` bash
$ npm install -g quasar-cli
```
Create a project folder (in this case is called *q-project* but you can name it whatever you want):
``` bash
$ quasar new q-project
$ cd q-project
```

You're all set now. Read about the Quasar CLI [here](/guide/cli-commands.html). Get to know how powerful it is so you can leverage it.
