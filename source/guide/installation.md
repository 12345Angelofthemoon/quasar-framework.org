title: Installation
---
Quasar relies on its own CLI (Command Line Interface) which does most of the heavy-lifting so you don't have to take care of the redundant tasks. You must install it to generate and manage a Quasar App.

## Installing Quasar CLI
Make sure you have at least NodeJS 4.2.0 (latest always recommended) and latest NPM.
``` bash
$ npm install -g quasar-cli
```

This is it. Next, [create your first Quasar App](/guide/create-app.html), read about the [Quasar CLI](/guide/cli-commands.html) and follow the next documentation pages on this Guide.
