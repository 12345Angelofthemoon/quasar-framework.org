title: Configuring Quasar App
---
As you've seen in [App Structure](/guide/quasar-app-structure.html) page (read it if you haven't already), there are a few key configuration files for your Quasar App.

## app.json
*Gets generated by the build system*

This is the place that all App configuration gets merged in. All pages manifests, all routes, and many more. You can build a search widget based on this file.

Example:
``` json
{
  "pages": {
    "index": {
      "hashes": [
        "$",
        ":article/:page"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## quasar.build.yml
This is the place to include your own dependencies, or configure the banner that is automatically added when building for Production, and many more.

> Note that the format must be YAML.

Example:
``` yml
deps:
  js:
    - 'node_modules/X/js/y.js'
    - 'node_modules/W/z.js'
  css:
    - 'node_modules/X/css/y.css'
preview:
  port: 3500
rpreview:
  port: 3600
banner: {}
test:
  exclude: []
```

### 'preview' property
