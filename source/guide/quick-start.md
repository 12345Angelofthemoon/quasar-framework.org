title: Quick Start
---

Create a project folder (in this case is called *q-project* but you can name it whatever you want):
``` bash
$ quasar new q-project
$ cd q-project
```

Finally install local project dependencies:
``` bash
$ npm install
```

You're all set now. You can start developing your application.
