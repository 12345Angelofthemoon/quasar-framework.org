title: Upgrade App to Latest Quasar
---
Upgrading an App to use the latest and greatest Quasar Framework version is easy.

``` bash
# within your App's folder:
$ npm update

# or
$ npm install --save quasar-framework
```

But first, be sure to check the [Release Notes](/guide/quasar-framework-release-notes.html) for breaking changes, if any.

Checking if a new version is available is also easy:

``` bash
# within your App's folder:
$ npm outdated
```
